# How to read a paper
Main source of information: [http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

Researchers must read papers to:
	- stay up to date,
	- revise their knowledge, or 
	- do literature surveys
-> researchers read papers for hundreds of hours every year
but graduate students are not thought how to read papers resulting in a lots of trial and error for them and wasted hours

## Three pass approach
an easier way of understanding papers consisting of three passes with each having a different goal:
	First pass: general **idea** of the paper
	Second pass: grasping the **content**, but not in details
	Third pass:  deep **understanding** of the paper
### First pass
5 to 10 minutes, getting a bird's-eye view of the paper
decide wether it's worth to read or not
1. Reading the title, abstract and introduction carefully
2. Read the section and subsection headings, but ignore their content
3. Read the conclusion
4. Glance over the references, ticking off the ones I've read

After reading all of this I will be able to answer these questions:
1. Category: what type of paper is it (measurement / analysis / description of a prototype)
2. Context: which other papers is it related to, which theoretical bases were used to analyse the problem
3. Correctness: does the assumption appear to be valid
4. Contributions: what are the main contributions of the paper
5. Clarity: is it well written
Based on these information you should decide wether the paper is worth to read or not.
Because of this if you write a paper take into consideration that most of the people will only read these things and put effort into them. Also this applies to reviewers


### Second pass
Should take up to an hour
This is where you read the paper with greater care, without details like proofs
1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations. (are the axes properly labeled, are results within error bars, are the conclusions statistically significant) these will distinguish rushed works from excellent ones
2. Mark relevant unread references for further reading (generally a good way to learn more about the background)
After this you should have a grasp on the content of the paper. 
You should be able to summarise the main thrust of the paper (with the supporting evidence) to someone else

If you don't understand the paper because the subject matter is new to you, the proofs are experimental or you are just tired or the paper is poorly written:
	(a) set the paper aside, hoping you donâ€™t need to understand the material to be successful in your career
	(b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or
	(c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

### Third pass
Four to five hours for beginners and an hour for experienced readers
To fully understand the paper (particularly for reviewers). You need to attempt to *virtually reimplement* the paper by making the same assumptions as the authors re-creating the work.


## Doing a literature survey
This is the hardest test of one's paper reading skills.

1. Use Google Scholar and well-chosen keywords to find three to five *recent* papers in the area.
2. Do one pass on these papers and read the related work sections.
3. If you are lucky you might stumble across a recent survey paper, then you are done.
4. Otherwise, in the second step find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key researchers in the area.
5. Download the key papers and set them aside, then go to their websites and see their recent published works. This will help identify the top conferences in that field.
6. Go to the websites of these top conferences and look though their recent proceedings. And find high-quality related work.

These papers with the ones set aside will constitute the first version of the survey.
Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
